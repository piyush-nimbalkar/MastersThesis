\label{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we developed a framework which takes any log file with unknown source and format, and automatically gives its semantic interpretation in the form of RDF Linked Data. We were able to split the log files with a very good recall, which means we got most of the columns that we were expecting. Also, we  effectively predicted the class labels of the columns in the log file. We can extend it to predict more classes of columns, by adding different specialists for every new column found in other log files. For the relation annotations, we were able to predict all possible relationships between the pairs of columns, with a high accuracy. The system performed well for actual log files as well as synthetically generated log files to simulate unknown source.

If we extend the ontology to have more classes and relations between the columns, then we can get a good semantic interpretation of any log file. This information can be used by tools to understand the log files more intelligently and help prevent our systems against unknown threats and attacks.
