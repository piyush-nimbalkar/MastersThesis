First and foremost, I would like to acknowledge my advisor Dr. Anupam Joshi who has been a great mentor throughout my thesis. I am grateful for his much needed guidance and patience. I would also like to thank Dr. Varish Mulwad for helping and guiding me not just during my thesis, but also during my entire Masters. This thesis would also not have been possible without the constant help, regular feedback from all my colleagues working in the Ebiquity lab at University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Last but not the least, a would like to thank my family and all my friends who stood by me in both good and bad times during the past two years.
