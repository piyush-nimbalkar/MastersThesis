I{\rq}d like to acknowledge first and foremost, my advisor Dr. Anupam Joshi who was a constant source of inspiration and much needed guidance. I am grateful for his patience through out my thesis. I would also like to thank Dr. Xuxian Jiang of NCSU for trusting me with his dataset. This thesis would also not have been possible without the constant help, regular feedback from all my colleagues working in the ebiquity lab at UMBC. And last but not the least, a big thanks to my brother Vaibhav, Maiee, Vaihini and all my awesome friends who stood by me through thick and thin in the last 2 years.
